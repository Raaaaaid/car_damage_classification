# Car Damage Classification

A small application based on TensorFlow and Keras for classifying car damage properties on images.

## Technologies

- TensorFlow/Keras
- SciKit Learn
- CUDA/cuDNN

## Local Development

### Dependencies
- CUDA compatible graphics card
- CUDA and cuDNN installed
- Access to TF-Hub to fetch pretrained models OR pretrained models locally at ./keras/models/~
- Python Environment configured
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
## Run Car Damage Application
- Adjust application_config.json to point to correct model files
- Update label files accordingly
```sh
  python main.py --config <path/to/your/application_config.json> --debug False
```

# Training Results

Training was done using cross validation. We report accuracy results for each iteration here. A more detailed results for each label can be found with each model inside a results.txt file.\
Each image shows two curves (blue: training set, orange: validation set). In
case of multi-class classification accuracy is measured with CategoricalAccuracy and loss with
CategoricalCrossentropy. In case of multi-label classification accuracy is measured with
BinaryAccuracy and loss with BinaryCrossentropy.

# Generalisation of the Models

To get a first impression of how the models work on different data we used a car damage dataset found on kaggle to produce test results.  
The dataset can be found at <https://www.kaggle.com/lplenka/coco-car-damage-detection-dataset> CSV ground truth used during testing can be provided on request.

As with training results we display BinaryAccuracy for multi-label problems.
For damage severity (here "Damage") which is a single-label problem CategorialAccuracy is shown.
