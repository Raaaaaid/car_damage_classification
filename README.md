# Car Damage Classification

A small application based on TensorFlow and Keras for classifying car damage properties on images.

## Technologies

- TensorFlow/Keras
- SciKit Learn
- CUDA/cuDNN

## Local Development

### Dependencies
- CUDA compatible graphics card
- CUDA and cuDNN installed
- Access to TF-Hub to fetch pretrained models OR pretrained models locally at ./keras/models/~
- Python Environment configured
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
## Run Car Damage Application
- Adjust application_config.json to point to correct model files
- Update label files accordingly
```sh
  python main.py --config <path/to/your/application_config.json> --debug False
```

# Training Results

Training was done using cross validation. We report accuracy results for each iteration here. 
A more detailed results for each label can be found with each model inside a results.txt file.
